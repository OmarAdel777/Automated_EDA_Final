# Automated_EDA_Final
Data Analysis and Visualization Tool
This Python script provides a simple data analysis and visualization tool using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. It allows users to load data from CSV or Excel files, preprocess the data, and generate various types of visualizations.

Features
Load Data: Load data from CSV or Excel files. Additionally, you can extend the script to load data from a SQL database.

Preprocess Data: Perform data preprocessing tasks such as generating summary statistics, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

Visualize Histograms: Create histograms for numerical columns in the dataset. Users can specify the number of bins for the histograms.

Visualize Scatter Plots: Generate scatter plots for numerical columns. Users can choose the X-axis column.

Visualize Bar Plots: Create bar plots for categorical columns. Users can specify a subset column, values to count, and the column for plotting.

Usage
Installation: Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (Pandas and Matplotlib) installed.

Running the Script: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. Run the following command:

Copy code
python script_name.py

Data Loading: When prompted, enter the path to your data file (CSV or Excel).

Data Preprocessing: The script will preprocess the loaded data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

Visualization Options: Choose from the following visualization options:

Histograms: Enter the number of bins for the histograms.
Scatter Plots: Enter the column for the X-axis in the scatter plots.
Bar Plots: Enter the subset column, values to count, and the column for plotting.
View Visualizations: The generated visualizations will be displayed in separate windows.

Extending the Script
You can extend this script to support additional functionalities, such as loading data from other file formats, integrating with different databases, or incorporating more advanced visualization techniques
